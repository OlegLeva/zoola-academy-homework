Task_3

Never used 'Git cherry-pick' great opportunity to try

I wanted to make a new repository, so I want to experiment in the future

i created two commits, created a new branch. made commits on it and a couple more commits in 'main'

There was a conflict at the first cherry-pick. I could return everything using "git cherry-pick --abort" but I decided to fight to the end))) fixing all the CONFLICTS, then everything worked out.

The only thing is that I struggled with the -e (--edit) flag and did not manage to change the name of the commit, but I will definitely solve this problem.
